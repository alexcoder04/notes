	<h1>alexcoder04's notes</h1>

	<p>These are alexcoder04's notes for the <a href="/Abi">German Abitur</a>, the <a href="/IB">IB Diploma</a> and <a href="/Uni">University</a>.</p>

	<p>Although I put a lot of work in these notes and use(d) them myself, I cannot guarantee that they are 100% complete, correct and up-to-date.</p>

	<p>I generally don't keep anything here up-to-date once it's uploaded, but feel free to contact me if you have any questions or find any errors. Use the usual messengers if you know me personally or write a mail to alexcoder04 [at] protonmail.com (don't expect to get an answer very quickly though)</p>

	<p><i>Have fun and good luck in your exams :)</i></p>
