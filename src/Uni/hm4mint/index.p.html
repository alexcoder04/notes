<p><a href="https://hm4mint.nrw/hm1/public/index.html" target="_blank">hm4mint</a> is a course organized by RWTH Aachen University which covers higher mathematics topics of the first semester for various engineering and natural science degrees.</p>

<p>I took the "linear algebra" specialization.</p>

<p>My notes here are somewhat messy, but more or less complete.</p>
